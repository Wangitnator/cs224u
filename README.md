# Stanford CS224u: Natural Language Understanding
Solutions for Stanford CS224U: Natural Language Understanding, Spring 2019

Here are my own solutions to all homeworks, for Prof. Christopher Pott's and Bill MacCartney's Masters-Level Machine Learning [course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/)

Each problem set and its solution are presented as distinct jupyter notebooks. Each is listed below. 

**NOTE:** the jupyter notebooks are in branch "2019-spring". The links below point to notebooks on this branch.
